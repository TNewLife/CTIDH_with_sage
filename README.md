This is a PoC implementation of CTIDH-1024 and CTIDH-2048, perhaps with some improvement.

## Dependencies
sagemath, version >= 10.1 (maybe >= 9.8 is enough).

*Sage's finite field arithmetic is needed (the 'Primefield' is just a wrapper for counting number of operations), elliptic curves and isogenies for testing our algorithms.*

See other requirements in requirements.txt.(`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
